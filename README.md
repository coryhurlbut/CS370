# CS370
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
-We were given most of the code to fix or modify in order to learn what parts do what. We then applied this and some given psuedocode to make the final project and optimize its performance. The part we did the most is implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm in the final project. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  -Computer scientists research and push forward the limits of digital technology. I see this as discovering how to use the technology in groundbreaking ways or finding ways to make new technology that can change the whole infrastructure. 
  
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  -I gather requirements to compare the current situation to, see where it needs to change, research and design a solution to that problem, implement the change, test that it works, document it to keep it sustained, and maintain it as necessary.
  
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  -To do no harm. To be accountable, have integrity, and never compromise.
